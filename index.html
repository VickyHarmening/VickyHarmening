        <h2> Get to know me </h2> <!-- Background on me and my interests outside programming. -->
        <p> After graduating from Mankato State University, Mankato, Minnesota with a degree in computer programming, I chose to work for a printing company. While I was there for 26 years, I learned everything I could about printing from entering the order to packaging the order for shipping.</p>
        <p> Now that my children are grown, I am looking at going back to my first love, programming computers. Currently, I am a student at Thinkful.</p>
        <p> When I am not studying or working you can find me </p>
